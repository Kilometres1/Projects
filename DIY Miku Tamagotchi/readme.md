This is a small (~3KB after compilation) Tamagotchi-like device I made. It has very little function but looks cute!
It uses an ATTiny85 Chip as its processor, a 128x64 SSD1306 OLED and a small LiPo battery. In low power mode it draws 1.6Î¼A, and in use it draws 4.3mA, both at 5V.
The Hatsune Miku image was copied off of the official Hatsune Mike Tamagotchis.
